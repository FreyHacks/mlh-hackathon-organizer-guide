# Check-in Process

It's important to have a clear check-in process day-of so you know who is attending. This data is valuable for your team and stakeholders in your event. For your team, it gives you a clear demarcation of who actually attended the event and finally who submitted. These stats help you know what exactly has been the reach for your event. For the sponsors, this data is again highly beneficial to know how many people actually got to know about their offering vs how many utilized them.

If you have already gathered all the fields you need from attendees, there a ton of ways to gather check-ins. If you missed a data category like address or age at registration, you can use check-in as an opportunity to get that info.

### Physical Check-ins

Check-ins for physical events are important to make sure you know who is at the venue. Having lanyards or nametags can help identify who is supposed to be at the venue, and also help put names to people who meet at the event.&#x20;

Organizers can have volunteers set up at table/s depending on the size. Make sure to have plenty of space for a line, and that it is spread out enough from sponsor tables that the area will not get congested with the initial flood of hackers.&#x20;

Have a way for the volunteers to verify the attendees have registered. A simple ctrl+f for the name in a google spreadsheet with a column to mark with an X is an easy way to set up check-in. Have assorted stickers/swag hackers can grab while volunteers are completing the check-in process. If your event requires school/state ID to verify identity this would be the time to check.&#x20;

Consider having a separate form for late registrations, even if they have to wait until after all preregistered attendees have had time to check-in.&#x20;

### Digital Check-ins

It is still important for Digital Events to have a check-in process. Examples include Discord bots, Google forms, and Typeform. If you have a separate registration platform, building in a small check in button that reveals all the day of information and links is a great way to get this done.
